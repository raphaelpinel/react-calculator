#React Calculator

a fun experiment with React iOS style!
See the live project here:

I had fun to code the css from scratch and the functionalities too!

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
